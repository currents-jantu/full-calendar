# Calendar Component Project - Planning

## 🚀 Vision

Create an open-source, reusable, and highly customizable calendar component for React, inspired by the UI/UX of Google Calendar. The component should seamlessly integrate into any React/Next.js application and support modern features like drag & drop, internationalization, responsive design, and accessibility.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a production-ready calendar UI for four main layouts:
  - Month view
  - Week view
  - Day view
  - Agenda (list) view
- Allow adding, editing, and deleting events
- Support drag-and-drop and resize interactions
- Responsive and mobile-friendly layout
- Internationalization and timezone support
- Modular, composable, and customizable components
- Built-in support for Next.js (v15) apps
- Developer-friendly API and TypeScript types
